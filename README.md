# University of Essex

I graduated with a master's degree at the University of Essex in one year. I got first honors (distinction), which has made me more knowledgeable in many areas from studying various subjects. 

1. [Machine Learning](https://github.com/micsupasun/university_of_essex/tree/main/machine_learning) predicts regression and classification multiple models. 
2. [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](neural_networks_and_deep_learning) predict data about electroencephalograms with Deep learning models such as CNN and LSTM models. 
3. [Data Science and Decision Making](data_science_and_decision_making) predict yield date with a regression model. 
4. [Big Data for Computational Finance](https://github.com/micsupasun/university_of_essex/tree/main/big_data_for_computational_finance) predicts fraud detection with the classification of both machine learning and deep learning. 
5. [Intelligent Systems and Robotics](intelligent_systems_and_robotics) control robots with PID controllers and fuzzy. 
6. [Text Analytics](text_analytics), which predicts Extreme Multilabel Text Classification fixes problems in applications in automatic tagging and recommendation systems of web-scale documents.  
7. [Group Project](group_project) on Assisting Blind People with AI and Audio by Using Smart Glass and Smartphones. I have predicted objects around spectacle wearers using custom object detection with TensorFlow and measuring object distance with the focal length method. After training the model for custom object detection, put the model on the google cloud platform and used Federated Learning to develop the model to be more accurate every week and the blind to connect the custom object detection and glasses via the Bluetooth of the phone. 
8. [Professional Practice](professional_practice_and_research_methodology) subject to finding a suitable professor to be my mentor and writing a research proposal before the dissertation.
9. I have done a [Dissertation](https://github.com/micsupasun/university_of_essex/tree/main/MSc_project_and_dissertation) to be made public about comparative speech emotion recognition in multiple models and multiple datasets, which have differences from other public research. There are four things that are not there. Firstly, This research uses 17 models divided into 11 machine learning models and six deep learning models to compare and find the best model because the study saw that most research used only 1 to 3 models. Secondly, This research uses four datasets because, in many datasets, there are too many male or female voices, but in this dataset, the number of male and female voices is similar. Neutral emotion is slightly less than other emotions, and only surprise emotion is much less than other datasets. The inclusion of datasets in this research can help solve the problem of overfitting and imbalanced data. Thirdly, Do the research and compare the data we want to predict, just emotion labels and data that intends to predict gender and emotion labels simultaneously, which in most research studies will only compare the emotion. Very few compare both gender and emotion labels. However, this research will compare both at the same time. Finally, Ensemble Learning is used to bring many models to vote, which makes the model more accurate, which is not present in most studies.
