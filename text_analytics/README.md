## Project objectives
1. The objective of this assignment is to explore the landscape of text classification. First, basic methods for text classification shall be identified and discussed. Subsequently, different research areas of text classification shall be identified. Finally, selected papers in the identified fields shall be discussed.

2. After Assignment 1 focused on the theoretical aspects of text classification, the objective of this assignment is to get practical experience in designing, implementing, running and scientifically evaluating your own XML classifier. The dataset will be a collection of two very large-scale resources of scientific papers in economics and medicine. Each `documentâ€™ in this dataset represents a record from a large document corpus. You can also use further datasets of your choice.

## First Assigment Documentation
[CE807-Assignment1-TextClassification-InterimReport.pdf](https://github.com/micsupasun/university_of_essex/blob/main/text_analytics/assignment_1/CE807-Assignment1-TextClassification-InterimReport.pdf) is the homework file I got from a professor teaching Text Analytics.

## First Assignment File
[Task1.pdf](https://github.com/micsupasun/university_of_essex/blob/main/text_analytics/assignment_1/Task1.pdf) is list of scientific papers found and considered for the review of basic approaches for text classification.

[Task2.pdf](https://github.com/micsupasun/university_of_essex/blob/main/text_analytics/assignment_1/Task2.pdf) is list of scientific papers found and considered for identifying
different fields of text classification and review of advanced methods and approaches for text classification.

[Task3.pdf](https://github.com/micsupasun/university_of_essex/blob/main/text_analytics/assignment_1/Task3.pdf) is scientific report produced for Task 3. It is mandatory to
include the source files (Word/LaTeX) and a PDF.

## Second Assigment Documentation
[CE807_text_analytic_assignment2.pdf](https://github.com/micsupasun/university_of_essex/blob/main/text_analytics/assignment_2/CE807_text_analytic_assignment2.pdf) is the homework file I got from a professor teaching Text Analytics.

## Second Assignment File
[machine_learning_v2.ipynb](https://github.com/micsupasun/university_of_essex/blob/main/text_analytics/assignment_2/machine_learning_v2.ipynb) The commented code written to perform the classification Task 2 (with comments describing the features and further information external to the original datasets you used, e.g. some entity graph or linguistic resource).

[CE807_text_analytic_assignment2.pdf](https://github.com/micsupasun/university_of_essex/blob/main/text_analytics/assignment_2/CE807_text_analytic_assignment2.pdf) The scientific report produced for Task 3. It is mandatory to include the source files (Word/LaTeX) and a PDF.
