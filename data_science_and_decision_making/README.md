# project objectives
The aim of this project is to develop a system that can help growers plan ahead for their crops by giving them information about the expected size of the crops in a future date. Using this system, they should be able to talk to supermarkets about when and how much produce they can sell them, resulting in a measurable gain for the growersâ€™ business. To do this, they have given you historical data from previous crops, as well as weather data.

[lab4_Causal_inference](https://github.com/micsupasun/university_of_essex/blob/main/data_science_and_decision_making/lab4_Causal_inference/lab4_Causal_Inference.ipynb)
We are going to combine our knowledge of regression and classification methods to estimate causal effects in observational data.

We will play around with two datasets of two different kinds:

1. Average effect (sodium)

2. Heterogeneous effect (toy dataset)

Steps in this lab:

1. Importing packages.

2. Average effect:

3. Problem description.

4. Evaluation metrics.

5. Loading and exploring the data.

6. Data pre-processing.

7. Training the models.

8. Performance evaluation.

9. Heterogeneous effect:

10. Repeat the same steps as for the average effect.
