This document specifies the coursework assignment to be submitted by students taking CE802.
Aims of this assignment are:
1. to learn to identify machine learning techniques appropriate for a particular practical problem;
2. to undertake a comparative evaluation of several machine learning procedures when applied to the specific problem.

[CE802_Assignment_2022.pdf](https://github.com/micsupasun/university_of_essex/blob/main/machine_learning/CE802_Assignment_2022.pdf) is the homework file I got from a professor teaching machine learning.

# Predict classification model
[CE802_P2_Notebook.ipynb](https://github.com/micsupasun/university_of_essex/blob/main/machine_learning/CE802_P2_Notebook.ipynb) is the file predict classification model

[CE802_P2_Test.csv](https://github.com/micsupasun/university_of_essex/blob/main/machine_learning/CE802_P2_Test.csv) is the classification dataset file
# Predict regression model
[CE802_P3_Notebook.ipynb](https://github.com/micsupasun/university_of_essex/blob/main/machine_learning/CE802_P3_Notebook.ipynb) is the file predict regession model

[CE802_P3_Test.csv](https://github.com/micsupasun/university_of_essex/blob/main/machine_learning/CE802_P3_Test.csv) is the regession dataset file
