# Group project for blind people

# project objectives
This application will help the visually impaired to carry out their daily activities without relying so much on others, enabling a 
more independent life for them. By implementing a federated learning approach, the distributed system of the edge computing 
devices will reduce the dependency on heavy computing systems required. Our research also aimed to reduce the latency as it is 
close to the speed of the network. This can be further enhanced by deploying the model to a larger scale which will help to collect 
more training data and improve the accuracy of the model which is on the cloud.
